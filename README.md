# React Router Dom - Unexpected Route Behavior
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom: unexpected route matching or navigation issues.
The `App.js` file showcases code that produces unexpected behavior. The `AppSolution.js` demonstrates the solution.
## Problem:
The original implementation might have issues with route matching, especially in scenarios involving nested routes or dynamic segments. Incorrect usage of hooks like `useParams` or `useLocation` could also cause unexpected results.  Navigation might not work as intended, leading to incorrect component rendering or errors. 
## Solution:
The solution focuses on correctly defining routes, handling edge cases and ensuring appropriate use of routing hooks. This includes carefully considering the order of routes, using wildcard routes effectively, and validating the usage of hooks like `useParams` and `useLocation` within the intended scope of the matched routes.
